## Abstract
Provide a concise summary of the project, its goals, the technologies used (Rust + Axum/Rocket/GTK4+/Tauri), and how functional programming principles were applied.

---

## Introduction
Explain the motivation behind the project:

- What problem does your application solve?
- Why did you choose Rust?
- Why integrate functional programming concepts?
- What makes your solution unique or interesting?

---

## Background and Concepts
Introduce key concepts relevant to the project:

### Technology Stack
- Rust  
- Framework (Axum, Rocket, GTK4+, or Tauri)  
- Async runtime (Tokio, if used)  
- Supporting crates (serde, anyhow, thiserror, etc.)

Each concept should give readers enough context to understand your design.
